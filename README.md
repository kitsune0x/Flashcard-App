# Flashcard-App
Simple flashcard app built using node.js and express.js. For this simple example app, I practiced using pug as a view render engine instead of EJS or React. 

##To setup on local environment, dowload and:
- run ``` npm install ``` in the app's root directory
- run ``` nodemon ``` to start the webserver on localhost:3000
